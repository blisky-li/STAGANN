More Information:
Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or inaccessible sensors, 
making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the missing temporal information. 
However, current models struggle with ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal patterns, 
especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. 
To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural Network ~(STA-GANN)~, 
a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. 
STA-GANN integrates (i) Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. 
(ii) Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships using temporal data and metadata; 
(iii) An adversarial transfer learning strategy to ensure generalizability.
Extensive validation across nine datasets from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior performance of STA-GANN.
